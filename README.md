# Semi-Supervised Meta-Learning

This repository contains the code for my project on Semi-Supervised Meta Learning for the Stanford class CS330: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning.

The projet report, containing a detailed description of the project is [here](report).

The implementation of Constrained DeepCluster is here: LINK HERE

# Usage

In order to run the experiments as described in the project report, go through the following steps:

1. Follow the instructions in LINK HERE to download and prepare the mini imagenet data set and run both DeepCluster and Constrained DeepCluster.
2. The following files are created as a result of running DeepCluster and Constrained DeepCluster. Copy these files over here into this directory. `labeled_tasks.npy`, `embedding.npy`, `images.npy`, `embedding_labeled.npy`, `embedding_unlabeled.npy`, `images_unlabeled.npy`. 
3.
